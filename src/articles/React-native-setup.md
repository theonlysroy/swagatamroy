## Introduction

This guide aims to help developers set up React Native on Ubuntu without Android Studio. By using lightweight tools and terminal-based workflows, you can save system resources and focus on coding.

## Why Avoid Android Studio?

Android Studio is a resource-intensive IDE, which can be overkill for many React Native developers. Instead, we can rely on:
- The Android SDK Command-Line Tools.
- Lightweight editors like Visual Studio Code or Vim.
- A physical Android device or an emulator for testing.
